    "Using python + natural language processing for topic modeling: a unsupervised technique for document classification\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/erickfis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a huge collection of documents, each one talking about a specific matter|subject.\n",
    "A document could be a movie description, or part of a book, a message, a tweet, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take the time to read each document, you will learn that they are talking about science, or politics,\n",
    "or medicine, or sports, etc, but very often they don't have a label specifying the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's your job to group them by subject. Will you read each one of them and label one by one?\n",
    "What if your collection contains 1 billion documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where *Topic modeling* comes in hand: it is a very useful technique for document classification through unsupervised learning. It will learn from the collection of documents as a whole and then suggest groups (clusters) of documents by similarities, such as frequency or probabilities for words on each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the documents are split into the suggested groups, we can then look at each group (through samples of them) and choose a proper label for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This clustering of documents by topic|subject can be achieved by different techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tf-idf + clustering\n",
    "- tf-idf + PCA\n",
    "- Latent semantic analysis - LSA\n",
    "- Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "On this notebook we will discuss the LDA method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a especial case of the Latent semantic analysis, where the priors distribution of topics are assumed to be\n",
    "of the beta multivariate type, aka. Dirichlet distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of LDA over LSI, PCA or regular clustering is that LDA is capable of detecting intermediary topics between the ones that would be detected by the former, as they will work on principal components and detect only orthogonal\n",
    "topics. Thus, LDA reduces overfitting and increases accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, LDA demands more computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case: chat bots\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are a big on line retailer and we want to provide a new communication channel for our costumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had a real time on line chat before and we were using a human attendant to answer our costumers. We have stored all of the costumers messages on our database and now we want to create an algorithm that is capable of answering costumers just like a human attendant would.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how to answer our costumers in a natural way, simulating the behavior of a human attendant?\n",
    "\n",
    "The achieve that goal, we are going to use natural language processing and topic modeling. We will combine different techniques for analyzing the costumers queries and questions to elaborate an appropriate natural answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- topic modeling - to orient the composition of a proper answer according to the detected subject of conversation.\n",
    "IE: if the subject is a complaint, the algorithm should compose an answer taking this information into account.\n",
    "If the message is a salutation, then salute back.\n",
    "- keyword detection, as order number, or some specific product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving stored messages from our database\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to \"train\" our algorithm, we must retrieve stored data from our databases.\n",
    "Note that this is not the typical training process because we don't have any targets or labels ready at this point. This is, in fact, a unsupervised training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the database in question is a NoSQL, like MongoDB, we could run queries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    db.mensagens.find(\n",
    "        {\n",
    "        $and: [\n",
    "                {\"user\": {$in: [\"user_1\", \"user_2\", \"attd_1\", \"sell_1\"]}},\n",
    "                {\"message\": {$ne: null}}\n",
    "              ]\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ).pretty()\n",
    "\n",
    "on MongoDB Compass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the messages are stored in a xml format, we could use the Beautiful Soup library to scrap the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    db = BeautifulSoup(open('db.xml').read(), \"lxml\")\n",
    "    messages = db.findAll('message')\n",
    "\n",
    "If the messages are stored on a txt file, we could scrap then using something as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    messages = []\n",
    "    with open(db.txt, \"rb\") as incoming:\n",
    "            for line in incoming:\n",
    "                if line.startswith('user'):\n",
    "                    messages.append(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the messages from the available database\n",
    "\n",
    "For this very particular notebook, we are going to use a very small set of messages containing some conversation between costumers and the attendants. The costumers are identified by the id \"user_1\"\n"
